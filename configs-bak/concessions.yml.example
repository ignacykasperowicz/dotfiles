# This file contains the template definitions for the 'concession_disclaimer' text.
# These are saved as an integer (:concession_text as of this writing) under the Unit model, so be careful when changing these values.
# Most important of all, the class that loads this has some error detection measures built-in. Mainly it checks if all :concession_text values in the Unit model have a corresponding key here, and bails if they do not. So, ensure every change to this file has a migration with it.
