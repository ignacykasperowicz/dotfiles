# Tomorrow Theme

**UPDATE** This repository is now obsolete and won't be updated. You may
install the official version by specifying a runtime path with
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

    Bundle 'chriskempson/tomorrow-theme', {'rtp': 'vim/'}

This is a Pathogen/Vundle friendly version of
[tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).

I'm not directly maintaining a fork of this code, it is kept up-to-date
automatically as new commits are pushed to the main project.
